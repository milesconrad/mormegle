# mormegle
Mormegle (more-mee-gull) is a recreation of the popular chat site Omegle, but without a chat box. You communicate with strangers using morse code, simply by pressing the button in the middle of the page. Built using the socket.io and express node modules.

After you visit the page and connect it'll look like this
![main-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milesconrad/mormegle/main/images/mainpage.png)
![connected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milesconrad/mormegle/main/images/connected.png)

This site is built using node, so to set it up run

```npm install```

then run

```node server.js```

and the server will be running on port 8080.
